What is your favorite movie?
The Shawshank Redemption or The Dark Knight

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Australia

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Superspeed because I think it is one of the most powerful superpowers.  It would make me amazing at sports like soccer, basketball, football, etc. and it would also be great for fighting crime because how can you lose a fight if you are moving so fast that you are just a blur.
